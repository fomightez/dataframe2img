# dataframe2img

[Pandas dataframe styling](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/style.html) is a great feature for visualizing tabular data right in a notebook; however, it is annoying that it gets removed from rendering when you reopen the notebook. (At least every place I have seen so far. Always to be the case?) I wanted a way to have at least the information visible when I reload. So an image would at least be viewable albeit not as interactive.

Pandas dataframe > pandas dataframe with conditional stylized cells > image > image viewable when notebook reopened.
